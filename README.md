# devtools

This repository houses guides and scripts to manage a local development environment.

## Native installation

Linux and MacOS are supported.

The native installation script uses:
* [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to manage dependencies
* [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage python versions
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) as an IDE. It's light-weight and free.

## Containerization utilities

TBD Docker setup, Mini-kube
